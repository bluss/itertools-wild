//! Itertools-wild â€” extra wild iterator adaptors, wild functions and wild macros.
//!
//! To use the iterator methods in this crate, import the [`ItertoolsWild` trait](./trait.ItertoolsWild.html):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use itertools_wild::ItertoolsWild;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Rust Version
//!
//! This version of itertools-wild requires wild Rust
//!
